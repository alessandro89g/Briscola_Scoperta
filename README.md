# Briscola_Scoperta

Briscola scoperta is an Italian card game. You can find the rules here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola .

This is a little different in the way that the players know each other cards and the next card to be drawn, so it needs a little more strategy to win.

For now it is only possible to play on the terminal and with two people.


In the future it will be extended to 4 and 5 people (briscola bugiarda) as well as hidden briscola.
Plus it will be added a GUI and the possibility to play against players with different platforms.
